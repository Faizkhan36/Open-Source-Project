code for transfer the file from server to client

Here is an example code using Python's built-in ftplib library to transfer a file from a server to a client:


import ftplib

def download_file(hostname, username, password, filename):
    ftp = ftplib.FTP(hostname)
    ftp.login(username, password)
    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
        ftp.retrbinary('RETR %s' % filename, f.write)
    ftp.quit()

hostname = 'ftp.example.com'
username = 'username'
password = 'password'
filename = 'example.txt'
download_file(hostname, username, password, filename)



This code connects to an FTP server at ftp.example.com using the specified username and password.
It then downloads the file example.txt from the server and saves it to the local file system. 
You can modify the code to suit your specific use case and requirements.
